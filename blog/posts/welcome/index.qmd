## A New Chapter Begins

We are excited to announce the official launch of **Youth Evangelism Training (Y.E.T.) Compassion** — a ministry born from a deep conviction that South Sudanese diaspora youth deserve more than survival. They deserve preparation, purpose, and a path forward rooted in faith.

## Why Y.E.T. Compassion?

Across the United States, thousands of South Sudanese young people are navigating life between two worlds — the traditions and values of their homeland, and the demands of a new society. Many face identity crises, leadership gaps, and fractured family structures without the support systems they need.

Y.E.T. Compassion exists to bridge that gap.

## Our Approach

We don't believe in quick fixes. We believe in **preparation before impact**, **community before individualism**, and **Scripture before strategy**. Our five strategic programs address the whole person — spirit, mind, family, community, and homeland:

1. **Youth Evangelism & Discipleship** — grounding young people in the Gospel
2. **Leadership Development & Mentorship** — building servant leaders
3. **Family Stability & Economic Empowerment** — strengthening families
4. **Community Building & Diaspora Advocacy** — connecting and empowering communities
5. **Service & Mission in South Sudan** — maintaining homeland ties

## Join Us

Whether you're a youth looking for mentorship, a family seeking support, a church wanting to partner, or a donor moved to invest in the next generation — there is a place for you here.

*Excellence is not what we aspire to — it's what we deliver.*
